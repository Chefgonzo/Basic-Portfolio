        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <img src="assets/Images/ME.jpg" alt="Picture of Me">

        <p1>Hello, my name is Mike Gonzalez. I recently completed the Coding Boot Camp at UCF for Full Stack Web Development. I live in Minneola, which is part of the greater Orlando area.</p1>
        <br>
        <p2>I am new to coding, but it is something that I love. There is nothing better than being faced with a challenge and having the know how and creativity to solve it. Before coding I had a career in Sales, which was great, but it wasn't something that I always enjoyed doing. Go ahead and insert your favorite joke about salespeople here.</p2>
        <br>
        <p3>When I'm not coding you can find me spending time with family, playing video games, cooking a gourmet meal, or having a nice relaxing day with my 2 dogs George and Rico. </p3>
        <br>
        <p4>Thanks For Visiting and Happy Coding!!!</p4>
